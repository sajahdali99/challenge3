# Challenge: 3

## Task: Be competent automating Jenkins

### What was the Challenge?
###### The challenge this week was to create a Jenkins pipeline that could build images and push those images into a Nexus Docker(host)

### How I expected the challenge to go.
###### I was worried about this weeks challenge more than the last 2 given my own struggles using Jenkins in the previous lesson. However that didn't deter me from trying due to feeling pretty confident in knowing the step by step process in creating scripts.

### What went well?
###### Despite being tough to execute, I found it fairly easy to understand the challenge. I felt competent in my understanding of each step to creating a Jenkins pipline.

### What didn't go as planned?
###### When telling Jenkins to build the pipeline I found that my images wouldn't build which would have a domino effect on every other subsequent command. The problem revolved around my .sh files as I had failed to execute the commands and give permissions for Jenkins to run the script.

### Possible improvements for future challenge.
###### It is evident that I need more independent learning hours dedicated to Jenkins pipline configurations as this challenge was a real struggle for me.
